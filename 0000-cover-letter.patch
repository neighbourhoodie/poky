Subject: [PATCH 0/3] Improvements for performance test report view

This work is done according to "Milestone 9: Build performance test report view" as stated in the Scope of Work with Sovereign Tech Fund (STF) (https://www.sovereigntechfund.de/).
The current report can be accessed here: 
Performance test report HTML (https://autobuilder.yocto.io/pub/non-release/20240117-15/testresults/buildperf-alma8/perf-alma8_master_20240117090048_663f180574.html)
The report is created using the `oe-build-perf-report` script in the poky repository. This script generates a performance test report in HTML format using the data from the yocto-buildstats (https://git.yoctoproject.org/yocto-buildstats/) repository.
The report displays the performance test results in line chart format. The chart x-axis represents the commit numbers, and the y-axis represents the test duration in minutes. 
The report also includes a table that displays the measurement statistics data for each test. The report is interactive and allows users to zoom in on specific sections of the line chart.

The current report format required some updates to make it more interactive and user-friendly. And this patch addresses such improvements:

- Add [Apache echart](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html) library to create oe build performance report charts and make them interactive.
- Restructure data to time and value array format to be used by echarts. It also converts test duration to minutes and adds zoom to the line charts.
- Update measurement statistics data to include `start_time` so that time can be displayed instead of commit numbers on the chart. It also updates default commit history length to 300.
- Add styling updates including page margin, labels for x and y axis, tooltip, and section descriptions.

For local setup, you can do the following:

1. Clone the yocto-buildstats (https://git.yoctoproject.org/yocto-buildstats/) and the poky repository (https://git.yoctoproject.org/poky/)

2. In the poky repository run the following to build the report HTML:
```bash
./scripts/oe-build-perf-report -r "LOCAL_PATH_TO_YOCTO_BUILDSTATS" --branch "master" --commit "663f1805742ff6fb6955719d0ab7846a425debcf" --branch2 "master" --html > test.html
```
Note:
- Add your local path to the yocto-buildstats repo
- The above command builds the report in a file called `test.html`. You can access it in the root directory in poky.
- This exmaple report uses the commit `663f1805742ff6fb6955719d0ab7846a425debcf` from `master` branch.
